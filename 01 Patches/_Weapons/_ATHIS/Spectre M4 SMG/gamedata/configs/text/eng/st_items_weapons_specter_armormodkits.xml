		<text>The Spectre M4 is a 9x19mm submachine gun developed in 1980s by Italian manufacturer SITES for use by counter-terrorist and police units. It has a compact design which makes it similar to the kiparis or MP5K and a high rate of fire. In The Zone, Spectre submachine guns are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it a very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a fighting weapon, and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.\n
